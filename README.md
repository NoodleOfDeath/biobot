---

This library is designed to automate dynamic updates to an social profile
account such as cycling through profile pictures every 30 seconds.

**Note**: the default refresh interval is set to 30000ms (30 seconds) for most
dynamic tasks. If this interval is set below 20 seconds, there is a chance
APIs will block requests if more than 200 are made within an hour.

This package uses [`url-regex-safe`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/url-regex-safe) ([GitHub](https://github.com/spamscanner/url-regex-safe)) to check for links when sending direct messages.
By default, the **safe** regex engine [`re2`](https://github.com/uhop/node-re2) is **not** installed.
âš  It's highly recommended for you to install `re2` by running `npm install re2`, else you _will_ be vulnerable to [CVE-2020-7661](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-7661).
